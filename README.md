- The main aim of this project was to identify how gender stereotypes have changed from a network perspective. For interactive shiny implementation, go to: https://arjunkmr.shinyapps.io/film_networks/

- 'main_script.R' contains all the code for all the statistical calculations and plots in our paper with respect to the network analysis. The 'data_function scripts' folder contains all the processed data and the function scripts called in the main script.

- 'exporatory_plots.R' contains the code for the exploratory analysis for the dataset and also the plots

- The 'create_process data' folder isn't essential since the processed data is already included. However, if you want to understand how the data was scraped and crape different number of data points, you could explore that.
